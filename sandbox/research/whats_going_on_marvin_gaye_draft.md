## 1. Background and Creation Story

### Origins: The Berkeley Incident (May 1969)
The song's genesis began with Four Tops member Renaldo "Obie" Benson, who witnessed police brutality against anti-Vietnam War protesters in Berkeley, California's People's Park on May 15, 1969—an event known as "Bloody Thursday." Disturbed by the violence, Benson began asking, "What is happening here? One question led to another. Why are they sending kids so far away from their families overseas? Why are they attacking their own children in the streets?"

### Songwriting Collaboration
- **Initial Composition**: Benson discussed his concerns with Motown songwriter Al Cleveland, who wrote and composed a song reflecting Benson's observations
- **Rejection**: Benson first offered the song to the Four Tops, but his bandmates rejected it, calling it "a protest song"—Benson insisted it was "a love song, about love and understanding"
- **Joan Baez Pass**: Folk singer Joan Baez also turned down the song
- **Marvin Gaye's Involvement**: In 1970, Benson presented the untitled song to Marvin Gaye, who was initially reluctant, thinking it would be better for The Originals (a vocal group Gaye was producing)
- **Gaye's Transformation**: Gaye revised the melody, added lyrics, and gave it the title "What's Going On". Benson later said: "Marvin definitely put the finishing touches on it. He added lyrics, and he added some spice to the melody. He added some things that were more ghetto, more natural, which made it seem more like a story than a song... We measured him for the suit and he tailored the hell out of it."

### Personal Inspirations
Gaye's own experiences shaped the song's depth:
- **Brother's Vietnam Service**: Gaye's brother Frankie served as a radio operator in Vietnam; his stories of death and destruction influenced the anti-war sentiments
- **Social Unrest**: Gaye was deeply affected by the 1965 Watts riots, leading him to question how he could "keep singing love songs" amid such turmoil
- **Personal Loss**: The death of duet partner Tammi Terrell in March 1970 plunged Gaye into depression and introspection
