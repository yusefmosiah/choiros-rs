## Artifacts

- `01KH51NHTT82YR7E4NYD6MRDZP` `SearchResults`: As of June 30, 2025, the global landscape is defined by significant economic shifts driven by the Trump administration's trade policies and growing geopolitical fragmentation. The U.S. economy is showing signs of a slowdown following a contraction in the first quarter, with the World Bank downgrading global growth forecasts to 2.3% and warning that the 2020s are on track to be the worst decade for growth since the 1960s. Financial markets are exhibiting a 'great rotation' away from U.S. assets; the dollar has plummeted over 10% in the first half of the year—its largest drop in 50 years—while gold and European defense stocks have surged to record highs. U.S. stocks, however, remain resilient near record highs, buoyed by the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' and a recovery from the tariff-induced volatility seen in April. Geopolitically, tensions are high with ongoing trade wars, a fragile truce in U.S.-China relations following talks in London, and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran that has roiled oil markets and raised fears of a broader regional war. The U.S. political climate remains fraught, with the administration aggressively pursuing immigration enforcement and federal overhauls, contributing to high levels of public anxiety according to recent polling.
