Summary: # Current AI News (February 2026)

## Top Stories

### **OpenAI's GPT-5 Roadmap Announced**
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has outlined a clear roadmap for GPT-5, which he says will arrive in "months" rather than years. Key points:
- **GPT-4.5** (codenamed "Orion") will launch in "weeks" as the final non-simulated reasoning model
- **GPT-5** will be a unified system integrating GPT-series and o-series models, including o3's capabilities
- The move aims to simplify OpenAI's increasingly complex product lineup
- **Access tiers:** Free users get unlimited GPT-5 at standard intelligence; Plus users get higher intelligence; Pro users get maximum intelligence

### **Google Unleashes Gemini 2.0 with 'Thinking' Capabilities**
Google has released its complete Gemini 2.0 model family to the public, marking a major push in agentic AI:
- **Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental**: New flagship model with 2 million token context window and superior coding performance
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Now generally available, optimized for high-volume tasks
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite**: Most cost-efficient model, outperforming Gemini 1.5 Flash at same price
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking**: "Thinking" model that reasons through problems, now available in the Gemini app
- [Google CEO Sundar Pichai says 2025 will be one of the biggest years for search innovation yet](https://digitaltrends.com/computing/even-more-ai-coming-to-google-search-2025)

### **Controversy: Google Ends Ban on AI Weapons Development**
Alphabet has rewritten its AI principles, dropping a longstanding ban on using AI for weapons and surveillance tools:
- Human Rights Watch calls the decision "incredibly concerning"
- The change removes language ruling out applications "likely to cause harm"
- Google defends the move, arguing democracies need AI that "supports national security"
- Raises concerns about autonomous weapons and accountability on the battlefield

## AI Efficiency Revolution

### **Test-Time Computing Breakthrough**
Researchers from UW, Ai2, and Stanford have developed a technique called **s1** that makes AI models "think longer" to boost performance:
- Achieves significant improvements in reasoning without expensive retraining
- Training cost was less than **$50** in cloud computing credits
- Part of broader trend exemplified by DeepSeek: improving AI performance while reducing costs
- [Source](https://www.geekwire.com/2025/cheaper-smarter-ai-uw-ai2-and-stanford-researchers-boost-model-by-making-it-think-longer/)

### **Google's $75 Billion AI Investment**
Despite efficiency gains from DeepSeek and other lean models, Google announced it will spend **$75 billion** on AI infrastructure in 2025, up 29% from analyst expectations.

## Policy & Governance

### **Current AI Partnership Launches**
A new "public interest" AI initiative backed by Google and Salesforce launches with **$400M+** in pledges:
- Focus on fostering AI in societally beneficial directions
- Aims to unlock access to high-quality datasets and support open-source infrastructure
- Backed by France, Germany, Chile, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, and others
- Notable that the U.S. government is not a participant
- [Source](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/google-backed-public-interest-ai-partnership-launches-with-400m-pledged-for-open-ecosystem-building/)

### **Global AI Governance Divide**
At the AI Action Summit in Paris, the United States and United Kingdom declined to sign a global declaration on AI governance, citing concerns over regulatory structures and national security. The EU and other nations moved forward with international standards for AI ethics and security.

## Industry Impact

### **Job Market Reality**
- Research reveals **276,000+ tech workers** lost jobs to AI-driven layoffs in 2024-2025
- AI insiders sounding alarms following February 5 releases of GPT-5.3 Codex and Opus 4.6 from Anthropic
- LinkedIn study: **72% of B2B marketers** feel overwhelmed by AI's rapid development

### **AI in Defense**
- **$9.8 billion** in autonomy spending hitting the AI-boosted defense supply chain
- AI in military market valued at **$22.41 billion** in 2026, projected to reach **$101 billion** by 2034
