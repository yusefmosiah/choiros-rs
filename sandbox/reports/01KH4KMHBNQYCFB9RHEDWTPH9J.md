## Objective

Research the latest Rust async runtime trends

## Step 1: Terminal

Research the latest Rust async runtime trends

```text
I attempted to research the latest Rust async runtime trends, but unfortunately encountered an issue. The search request was blocked by Google's bot detection system, which returned an error page instead of search results.

To get you the information you're looking for about Rust async runtime trends in 2026, I would suggest:

1. **Try a direct search yourself** - Visit search engines or specialized Rust resources directly
2. **Check these authoritative sources**:
   - The official Rust blog (blog.rust-lang.org)
   - This Week in Rust newsletter
   - Rust async working group updates
   - GitHub trending Rust projects
   - Reddit's r/rust community

3. **Key async runtimes to research**:
   - **Tokio** - The most popular runtime
   - **async-std** - Standard library-like async runtime
   - **smol** - Lightweight alternative
   - **Embassy** - For embedded systems
   - **Glommio** - Thread-per-core architecture

Would you like me to try a different approach, such as checking specific documentation sites or repositories directly?
