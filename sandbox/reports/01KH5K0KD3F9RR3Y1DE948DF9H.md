## Overview
"What's Going On" is a landmark song by Marvin Gaye, released as the lead single from his 1971 album of the same name. This iconic track is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential songs in music history, marking a significant departure from traditional Motown sound and establishing a new era of socially conscious soul music.

## Song Creation and Background

### Inspiration and Writing
- **Origin**: The song was originally conceived by Four Tops member Renaldo "Obie" Benson after witnessing police brutality against anti-Vietnam War protesters in Berkeley, California, on May 15, 1969, an event known as "Bloody Thursday" [1][2]
- **Collaboration**: Benson worked with Motown songwriter Al Cleveland to develop the concept [3][4]
- **Gaye's Contribution**: Marvin Gaye added his own lyrics, revised the melody, and tailored the song to his vision. Benson later remarked: "We measured him for the suit and he tailored the hell out of it" [5]

### Personal Context
- Gaye was deeply influenced by his brother Frankie's experiences in the Vietnam War
- The song reflected Gaye's own disillusionment with social conditions, including the Watts riots and his grief over the death of duet partner Tammi Terrell
- Gaye stated: "With the world exploding around me, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs?" [6]

## Confusion with 4 Non Blondes' "What's Up?"

### Common Misconception
- The 1992 song "What's Up?" by 4 Non Blondes is frequently misremembered as "What's Going On" due to its prominent chorus lyrics
- **Why the Title Difference**: 4 Non Blondes intentionally titled their song "What's Up?" specifically to avoid confusion with Marvin Gaye's classic [11]
- **Written by**: Linda Perry
- **Chart Performance**: Reached #14 on US Billboard Hot 100, #1 in multiple European countries
- **Cultural Impact**: Despite being a one-hit wonder, the song has endured as an anthem of frustration and confusion
- **Key Difference**: While both songs ask questions about societal problems, Gaye's is a specific political commentary, while Perry's is more personal and open to interpretation

## Lasting Legacy

### Continuing Relevance
- The song's themes of war, social injustice, and environmental concerns remain tragically relevant
- Used frequently in protests and social movements
- Continues to inspire artists addressing social issues
- Regularly featured in films, TV shows, and commercials

### Influence on Music
- Pioneered the fusion of soul music with political commentary
- Influenced generations of artists from Curtis Mayfield to Kendrick Lamar
- Helped establish the album as an art form rather than just a collection of singles
- Demonstrated that commercial success and artistic integrity could coexist

### Quotes on Significance
