  - Notes are required for every skill usage.
  - Notes are not learnings; learnings emerge from notes and should not be forced.
  - Do not label notes as learnings; avoid collapsing interpretation.
  - Each skill usage should signal how to improve the skill's performance/execution.
  - Need an instant messaging flow with the coding agent system: short deltas and long-form prompts.
  - Agentic attention boundaries matter; capture notes without blurring the primary work stream.
  - Goal state: record multi-minute monologue prompts while the system keeps operating live.
  - Streaming is not a priority yet; summaries work but are slow. Turn-by-turn responses may be preferred.
  - Token streaming can shape attention and conversational texture; useful when deeply focused.
