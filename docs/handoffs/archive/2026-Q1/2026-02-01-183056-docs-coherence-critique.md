## Session Metadata

- Project: /Users/wiz/choiros-rs
- Branch: main

### Recent Commits (for context)

- 471732b actorcode dashboard progress
- 473ca07 actorcode progress

## Handoff Chain
- **Continues from**: `docs/handoffs/2026-02-01-180203-docs-upgrade-notes-bus.md`
- **Supersedes**: None

## Current State Summary
- Documentation upgrade plan and multi-agent vision bridge doc are now in the repo.
- Multiple doc review notes were added under `docs/notes/`.
- Next deliverable is a coherence critique of the docs (consistency + contradictions).

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Spawn a docs coherence critique attempt** (micro supervisor + nano workers)
   - Focus: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/AUTOMATED_WORKFLOW.md`,
     `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, `docs/CHOIR_MULTI_AGENT_VISION.md`,
     `docs/DOCUMENTATION_UPGRADE_PLAN.md`, `progress.md`.
   - Output must be a single Markdown doc (no in-task summary).
   - Identify contradictions, stale claims, and missing links.

2. **Record contradictions as notes, not learnings.**

## Context for Resuming Agent
- Notes are first-class and distinct from learnings.
- Coherence is the minimum verification bar; repo-truth is next.
- Doc critique output should be actionable and scoped (file + suggested fix).
